Project homepage:

To link this into your existing GWT checkout:
  cd user/src/com/google/gwt/
  svn ps svn:externals 'jsio http://gwt-api-interop.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/jsio/' .
  <repeat for user/tests, if desired>
  cd <checkout root>
  svn update

You'll now track future updates to the interop package when you do an svn update.

The sample HelloMaps application demonstrates how the interop package can be used with Google Maps.  Refer to Hello.gwt.xml for instructions on obtaining a Google Maps API key.

Enjoy.
